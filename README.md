# MVG_Widget
This MVG Widget is a little app for displaying train departure and arrival in Munich. 
It is optimized for the usage on small screens. 
However, the initial idea was to build it for a Raspberry Pi 4 - which now has its place in the kitchen. :p
The app fetches the data from the mvg server constantly and displays the first part of the connection.
